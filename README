NAME
    Net::IPAddress::Filter::IPFilterDat - A fast IP address filter from
    ipfilter.dat

VERSION
    version 20121119

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::IPAddress::Filter::IPFilterDat;

        my $filter = Net::IPAddress::Filter::IPFilterDat->new();

        $filter->load_file('/tmp/ipfilter.dat');
        # Or
        $filter->load_file($FILEHANDLE);
        # Or
        $filter->add_rule("000.000.000.000 - 000.255.255.255 , 000 , invalid ip");

        print "BLOCKED\n" if $filter->in_filter('192.168.1.20');

DESCRIPTION
    An ipfilter.dat file holds a list of IP address ranges, and is often
    used by p2p clients such as eMule or various bittorrent clients to block
    connections to or from the listed addresses.

    Net::IPAddress::Filter::IPFilterDat can read in these files and provides
    a fast (greater than 100k lookups per second) way of seeing if an IP
    address should be filtered/blocked.

    There is a dependency on the XS module Set::IntervalTree so a c++
    compiler is required. The XS data structure is the reason for the small
    RAM usage and high performance of the IP address filter.

METHODS
  load_file( )
    Fetches rows from an ipfilter.dat-formatted file and adds the ranges to
    the filter. Can be called with a filename, or with an opened filehandle.
    The filehandle is closed after reading.

    Expects:

        $file - Either a filename, or a filehandle.

    Returns:

        Number of rules added from the file.

  add_rule( )
    Given a line from an ipfilter.dat file, add the rule to the filter.

    Expects:

        $rule - A string containing an ipfilter.dat rule.

    Returns:

        1 if rule was parsable and added to the filter.

        0 otherwise.

FUNCTIONS
  _parse_rule( )
    Given a line from an ipfilter.dat file, try to parse out the fields.

    Expects:

        $rule - A string containing an ipfilter.dat rule.

    Returns:

        A hashref of the fields if parsable.

        Otherwise undef.

    *   Support for reading zipped or gzipped ipfilter.dat files.

    *   Support for the score field in ipfilter.dat.
